brew_controller
==================
Repo for arduino code for my brewery controller (RIMS process).

This controller assumes you have 3 SSR-controlled water heater elements:
- One for the Hot Liquor Tank (HLT)
- One for the RIMS tube
- One in the Boil Kettle (BK)

There are 3 operation modes provided:
- HLT temp control only
- RIMS temp control with HLT temp control
- BK duty cycle control
